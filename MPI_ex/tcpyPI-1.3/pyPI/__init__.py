pyPI: Tropical Cyclone Potential Intensity Calculations in Python
----------------------------
pyPI is a set of functions, scripts, and notebooks that compute and validate tropical cyclone potential intensity (PI) calculations in Python. It is a port of the Bister and Emanuel (2002) algorithm (Bister and Emanuel 2002) which was originally written in FORTRAN---and then converted to MATLAB---by Prof. Kerry Emanuel (MIT).
